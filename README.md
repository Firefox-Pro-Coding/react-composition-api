## Install
```sh
# react 16.8 is required for hooks
# mobx and mobx-react-lite is required for reactivity
yarn add react mobx mobx-react-lite
yarn add @firefox-pro-coding/react-composition-api
```

## Usage
```ts
const Component = defineComponent((props) => renderFunction)
```
Pass a setup function to `defineComponent` to create a Component.  

`setupFunction` receive props object as an argument. `props` is a [shallow reactive object](https://mobx.js.org/refguide/api.html#decorators), you can use `reaction` to watch changes on props.

Upon component per component instance creation, `setupFunction` will be running only once and should return a function accepts no argument that returns JSX. Only the returned function will be running again to generate the new virtual dom.  

Normally, you need to tear down mobx `reaction` watchers when component unmounted. If you'd like to get it automatically done, import these reactivity utilities wrappers from `@firefox-pro-coding/react-composition-api`, or use the babel plugin to transform imports from `mobx` to this package. In setupFunction, synchronized calls to mobx reactions will be detected and tear down automatically when component unmount.

```js
// using wrapper from @firefox-pro-coding/react-composition-api
import {
  observable,
  reaction,
  autorun,
  when,
} from '@firefox-pro-coding/react-composition-api'
```
```js
// or using babel to auto transform
// .babelrc.js
module.exports = (api) => {
  api.cache.using(() => process.env.NODE_ENV)

  return {
    plugins: [
      '@firefox-pro-coding/react-composition-api/babel',
    ],
  }
}


// import from mobx
import { observable, autorun, when, reaction, observe } from 'mobx'
// will be transformed into
import { observe } from 'mobx'
import {
  observable,
  autorun,
  when,
  reaction,
} from '@firefox-pro-coding/react-composition-api'
```


## Counter Example
```tsx
import React from 'react'

import {
  defineComponent,
  onMounted,
  onUnmounted,
  reaction,
  observable,
} from '@firefox-pro-coding/react-composition-api'

export const App = defineComponent((_props) => {
  const state = observable({
    count: 0,
  })

  const box = React.createRef<HTMLDivElement>()

  // life cycle hooks
  onMounted(() => { console.log('mounted') })
  onUnmounted(() => { console.log('unmounted') })

  // observation
  reaction(
    () => state.count,
    () => { console.log('new value is', state.count) },
    { fireImmediately: true },
  )

  // methods
  const handleAdd = () => { state.count += 1 }
  const handleSub = () => { state.count -= 1 }

  // render function
  return () => (
    <div ref={box}>
      <div>{state.count}</div>
      <button onClick={handleAdd}>add</button>
      <button onClick={handleSub}>sub</button>
    </div>
  )
})
```

## Api Reference
- **defineComponent**
  ```jsx
  const Component = definedComponent((props) => () => {
    // props is shallow reactive
    // define your state actions in here

    // the render function used to render the component
    // will be wrapped in mobx.observer automatically
    return () => (
      <div>component</div>
    )
  })
  ```
  Pass a `setupFunction` to defineComponent to create a component. setupFunction should return a render function that receives no arguments and returns JSX.  

  setupFunction receive `props` as it's argument. `props` is a stable reference and made shallow reactive, so you can use mobx reactions to watch changes on props.

- **observable, reaction, autorun, when**
  These are wrappers of mobx api and do exactly the same thing as the same name in mobx, except when called synchronously inside the setupFunction, and will be automatically disposed when component unmount.  

  Use the babel plugin to auto transform these imports from mobx to this package.

- **onMounted, onUnmounted**
  ```ts
  onMounted(() => { console.log('mounted') })
  onUnmounted(() => { console.log('unmounted') })
  ```
  Callbacks will be called when the component mounted and unmounted.  

  Callback are wrapped in `React.useEffect` hook, so using onMounted and onUnmounted is basically the same as React.useEffect with an empty array as deps, except it is allow to use inside if statement, and the order doesn't matter.  

  Reactions won't be auto torn down in life cycle hooks.  

  Tips: You can call `onUnmounted` synchronously inside `onMounted`.

- **runhook**
  ```ts
  runHook(() => {
    const value = React.useContext(MyContext)
    state.contextValue = value
  })
  ```
  Callback passes to `runHook` will run every time before the component renders, just like normal hooks.  

  To react to changes, modify the state inside the callback. Normal hooks rules apply here, so you cant call hooks inside if statement.

  Despite its name runHook, you can put anything inside it. It runs in every render, like in a normal functional component. putting a console.log in here is a typical way to monitoring re-renders.

- **getOriginalProps**
  ```ts
  runHook(() => {
    const originalProps = getOriginalProps(props)
  })
  ```
  Get the non-reactive props object, it can be use to prevent duplicate render cause by making the props reactive. If a component using some props in the render function, each time props update, the component will re-render twice, the first render is caused by React updating props, and the second render is caused by the reactive props update. Normally you wouldn't need to use this, but it's useful when there are some components with frequent props updates or heavy rerender function.

  It's not a stable reference, so get it as close as where you want to use it.
